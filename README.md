# Hi there 👋
I'm **jbgy**, also known as **JBugel** or just **jb**.
I mess around with code, music, and random projects that usually end up on GitHub or my own site.

## 🌐 Personal Website
I've been rewriting my site a couple of times already.
Currently working on **v4**, which is in active development.
- [v2 (old but working)](https://github.com/jbgy/website)
- [v3 (experimental mess)](https://github.com/jbgy/web)
- [v4 (WIP, active dev)](https://git.jbugel.xyz/jb/website)

The site is my little playground: blog posts, projects, experiments with design/tech, and whatever else I feel like putting online.

## 🎵 Music
Besides coding, I also make music. You can find my stuff on **Spotify** and most other streaming platforms

👉 [Spotify Artist Page](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4QW2HVb8BGuCC0Ai3DEko5)

It's mostly electronic, with a mix of different vibes depending on what I'm into at the moment.

## 💻 Projects & Things I Do
- Building and breaking my own tools (sometimes useful, sometimes just for fun). - Playing around with SvelteKit, Tailwind, and other web stuff.
- Learning by doing → a lot of trial and error, but that's the fun part.
- Hosting random services on my own infra (yes, self-hosting is addictive).

💡 I like keeping things simple, but I'm always tweaking, learning, and experimenting. If you stumble across one of my repos, feel free to open issues, PRs, or just lurk. I don't mind.
